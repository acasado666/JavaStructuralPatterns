##Adapter Pattern

###Concepts
Plug adaptor

Convert interface into another interface

Legacy

Translates requests

Client, Adapter, Adaptee

Examples:
    Arrays -> Lists, 
    Streams

###Design

Client centric

Integrate new with old

Interface, but not required

Adaptee can be the implementation

###Contrast Adapter vs. Bridege

####Adpater
Works after code is designed

Legacy

Retrofitted

Provides different interface

####Bridge
Designed upfront

Abstraction and implementation vary

Built in advance

Both adapt multiple systems 

###Adapter Summary
Simple solution

Easy to implement

Integrate with Legacy

Can provide multiple adapters
